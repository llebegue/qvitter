Setup
-----

1. Install GNU Social

2. Put all files in /plugins/Qvitter

3. Replace your lib/apiauthaction.php file with the one supplied in 
edited-gnu-social-files/lib/apiauthaction.php. (this might not be needed if you are
running the latest GNU social nightly)

4. Add `addPlugin('Qvitter');` to your /config.php file.

5. It's recommended to set this setting in your /config.php file: `$config['thumbnail']['maxsize'] = 3000;`

6. There are a few settings in /plugins/Qvitter/QvitterPlugin.php. By default Qvitter is 
opt-out for users. If you set `$settings['enabledbydefault'] = false;` Qvitter will
be opt-in instead.

7. Users can go to ://{instance}/settings/qvitter and enable or disable Qvitter.

Optional
-----

For easy updates, you can use /config.php to override the settings in /plugins/Qvitter/QvitterPlugin.php.
For example, add this to your /config.php file:

````
// Qvitter-settings
$config['site']['qvitter']['enabledbydefault'] = true;
$config['site']['qvitter']['defaultbackgroundcolor'] = '#f4f4f4';
$config['site']['qvitter']['defaultlinkcolor'] = '#0084B4';
$config['site']['qvitter']['timebetweenpolling'] = 5000;
$config['site']['qvitter']['urlshortenerapiurl'] = 'http://qttr.at/yourls-api.php';	
$config['site']['qvitter']['urlshortenersignature'] = 'b6afeec983';	
$config['site']['qvitter']['sitebackground'] = 'img/vagnsmossen.jpg';
$config['site']['qvitter']['favicon'] = 'img/favicon.ico?v=4';
$config['site']['qvitter']['enablewelcometext'] = true;
$config['site']['qvitter']['blocked_ips'] = array();
$config['thumbnail']['maxsize'] = 3000;
````

Note: Qvitter is tested with GNU Social version 1.1.1-alpha2 (7e47026085fa4f2071e694d9c3e3fe2aa5142135).
